# Traffic-Simulation-System
## Overview
This project is a simplified simulation of a traffic light system designed to mimic the behavior of a traffic light controlled intesection of 4 road (each road with two cardinalities). It uses a command-line interface to provide details such as the summary of movement as well as GUI to display the illustrated flow.

## Features
Queues -  these hold the density of cars in the different roads
Lanes - these are classes that represent the 4 
GUI - this simulates the flow to give a visual representation of movement of cars
